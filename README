This super simple tool does nothing but a loop-through between the default
capture and default playback device. In contrast to a simple "arecord | aplay",
this program will start writing samples regardless whether there was any input
from the capture device yet.

This was needed for embedded hardware that isn't able to record unless the
playback stream is running.

Everything is hard-coded to achieve just that.

On top of that, it might serve as an example to anyone who wants to write
an ALSA application.
