ESG BSP Test Suite : Audio and SPI
==================================

This application provides low-level stubbing for the BSP interfaces, to assess robustness.

## Audio Loop

Based on a sample app from http://equalarea.com/paul/alsa-audio.html

## SPI/TDMA Protocol Stub

Using Elite/SPI protocol, provide an audio frames streaming stub: 
* the VO8346 must be in audio mode
* linux is spi-master, this application must listen to the "slave-ready" GPIO, and initiate an spi transfer using spidev when the GPIO is asserted.
